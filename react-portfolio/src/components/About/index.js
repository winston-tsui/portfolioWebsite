          Hello! I'm Winston Tsui, from Queens, New York City! I currently
          attend Syracuse University, in my last year, studying Computer
          Science! Previously, I have interned at NYC Department of Correction,
          NYC Department of Design and Construction, and Palapa. I have also
          gained incredible interpersonal and communication skills while working
          at Mount Sinai Hospital. I'm in the process of joining Tau Beta Pi
          honor society now and am looking to apply to further my knowledge,
          experience and passion for software engineering.
        </p>
        <p>
          I am certified by Microsoft in Azure AI Engineering, so I am familiar
          with a large chunk of artificial intelligence services and resources
          from Microsoft. But I want to learn more about the actual underlying
          functions and frameworks that are behind these services in PyTorch and
          other frameworks, and I think this opportunity is a great way for me
          to learn more.
        </p>
        <p>
          Overall, I believe there is a bit of a learning curve for me, but I
          strongly believe I come equipped with the necessary and basic
          knowledge in programming and machine learning knowledge to make a
          meaningful impact. Previously, I have interned as a software
          engineering intern, an application developer intern as well as a
          desktop support intern. I also have created android application
          projects and would love to talk more about this. I would love to help
          and contribute in any way I can.
        </p>
